Visualize the movement of dancers

This sketch was created during a 4-days workshop in Mainz in April 2019. 
The idea was visualizing the footsteps each dancer did during a 3-minutes-dance-play.

Here you can see how it looks.

<h1>Realization</h1>

I this script I focused on three parameter:

1. Dancers' location
So in order to see where the dancer have been standing during the play and how the connection between them was the grey shadow makes this visual.


2. Relation
The lines connect the players foot with each other. So you can see where the are walking, how far they are from each other and if the are making simmetric movements.

3. Speed:
Each time a dancers foot toches the floor a bubble appears. The faster they walk the bigger grows the bubble around them.
